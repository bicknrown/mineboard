### translation layer for midi keyboard to hid keyboard

##this is garbage and i never want to touch this implementation again, thus it is now archived

the theory is that we use a m-audio keystation 49es to play minecraft,
what we got so far was a glorified text entry device.

as of 9/8/19 the entries made by the emulated keyboard are not accepted by most games.
##
## Planned features (?)
* config file for adjusting amount of keys, mapping of keys, etc.. 
* make it work so that it is actually useful in games and not just notepad
* probably some other cool stuff
* a gui?

#### _Disclaimer_
we are doing this in our spare time, if you actually wanted to use this,
there are probably thousands of better ways to develop something like this.
